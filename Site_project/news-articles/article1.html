                <p>
                In the context of ongoing war, 
                addressing the mental health of those who 
                support others - psychologists, educators, 
                and humanitarian workers‚Äîhas become not only 
                urgent but essential. On April 25, 2025, 
                professionals from across Ukraine and abroad 
                came together for the All-Ukrainian 
                Scientific-Practical Conference with International 
                Participation: "Promoting the Mental Health of 
                Psychological Service Providers During Wartime."
                <br>
                <br>
                One of the key highlights of the conference 
                was a panel discussion titled ‚ÄúInclusion in 
                Research and Collaboration,‚Äù as a part of EPERE 
                project which underscored the importance of 
                inclusive approaches in psychological support 
                and education during crises.
                <br>
                <br>
                üéôÔ∏è The discussion was moderated by Dr. Kateryna 
                Bondar, SCAS fellow and Associate Professor 
                at the Department of Practical Psychology and 
                Project Manager at Kryvyi Rih State Pedagogical 
                University. Her guidance helped create a space 
                for cross-sectoral dialogue on inclusive 
                education and participatory research.

                The session, chaired by Assoc. Prof. Sevgi 
                Bayram √ñzdemir from √ñrebro University (Sweden), 
                featured powerful contributions from international 
                experts:
                <br>
                <br>
                Fionn Crombie Angus and Jonathan Angus 
                (Fionnathan Productions, Ireland) opened the 
                session with a presentation on "Participation 
                in Research," focusing on inclusive practices 
                and self-advocacy in research involving individuals 
                with disabilities.
                Maria Sj√∂lin (Herrljunga Municipality) and Alexandra 
                Jonasson (Lerum Municipality), both Special Education 
                Needs (SEN) teachers from Sweden, followed with their 
                talk on "Key Success Factors in Collaborating on the 
                Education of Students with Intellectual Disabilities." 
                Their real-world insights highlighted the role of 
                empathy, partnership, and localized adaptation in 
                educational systems.
                <br>
                <br>
                The session fostered valuable discussions about 
                shared responsibilities in mental health support, 
                the risks of burnout and compassion fatigue, and the 
                necessity of valuing the wellbeing of those who serve 
                others.
                <br>
                <br>
                This event was not just an academic exchange - 
                it was a reaffirmation of the human commitment to 
                care, dignity, and resilience, even in the face 
                of ongoing adversity. It demonstrated that inclusive, 
                cross-border collaboration is not only possible - it 
                is vital.
                <br>
                <br>
                As Ukraine continues to navigate the challenges of 
                war, events like this one help build a future 
                where psychological services are sustainable, 
                equitable, and rooted in solidarity.
